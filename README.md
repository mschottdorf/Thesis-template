This Latex code is published under the GNU General Public License v3.0, but if you like send me a postcard.

== Compilation ==

The individual chapters are organized as .tex files in folders contining the relevant images and data. The bibliography is automatically generated by biblatex

To get a pdf, just compile the master file, "body.tex".
